# SecureMessenger
SecureMessenger is a web-based secure messaging application inspired by Telegram's dual-chat system. It supports both Secret Chats (end-to-end encrypted) and Cloud Chats (server-assisted delivery with encryption in transit). The app is built with a focus on cryptographic integrity, secure key exchange, and forward secrecy.

## üöÄ Features
‚Ä¢	**Secret Chats**: True end-to-end encryption using Diffie-Hellman key exchange and AES-256-IGE. The server cannot read or decrypt any messages.

‚Ä¢	**Cloud Chats**: Encrypted transport layer, server can decrypt and store messages for delivery across devices.

‚Ä¢	**Forward Secrecy**: Implements automatic re-keying after 100 messages or 7 days for Secret Chats.

‚Ä¢	**Real-Time Communication**: Built using WebSockets for live messaging.

‚Ä¢	**In-Memory Message Queuing**: Messages are temporarily stored if the recipient is offline (no persistent storage).

## üõ† Tech Stack
**Frontend:**
‚Ä¢	HTML, TailwindCSS

‚Ä¢	Vanilla JavaScript
**Backend:**
‚Ä¢	Node.js with TypeScript

‚Ä¢	ws (WebSocket library)

‚Ä¢	crypto (built-in Node.js module for cryptography)
**Cryptographic Components:**
‚Ä¢	Diffie-Hellman key exchange

‚Ä¢	AES-256 encryption (IGE simulation)

‚Ä¢	SHA-256-based Key Derivation Function (KDF)

## üîê Chat Modes Explained
**Secret Chat**
‚Ä¢	Diffie-Hellman public key exchange

‚Ä¢	Shared key derived on client

‚Ä¢	Messages encrypted with AES-IGE using derived key

‚Ä¢	Server is unaware of message content
**Cloud Chat**
‚Ä¢	Auth key established via Diffie Hellman during login

‚Ä¢	Each message is encrypted with a derived key using SHA-256 and AES

‚Ä¢	Server decrypts, stores temporarily, and re-encrypts for the recipient

## üì¶ How to Run Locally
1. **Clone the repo** and **cd SecureMessenger**

2. **Install dependencies**
**npm install**

3. **Run the app**
**npm run dev**

4. **Open two browser tabs to simulate users**

## üìò Notes
‚Ä¢	No database is used ‚Äî all message storage is ephemeral and in-memory.

‚Ä¢	Keys and payloads are logged to console for debugging/demo purposes.
